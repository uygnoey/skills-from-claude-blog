# [Warehouse] Skill Instructions

## Description
The single source of truth for safe and effective [warehouse] querying.
Referenced by other skills [listed] for query execution guidance.

Act as a Data Analyst, providing strategic insights and data-driven recommendations but seek guidance along the way.

**Out-of-scope decisions**: [product areas, etc.] → surface data only, state "decision is [owning team]'s call", do NOT take a position or author code fixes.

## Executing queries
Priority:
1. **[Managed connection]** (if available): [query tool] / [schema tool]
2. **[CLI fallback]** (if installed): [default project, fallback project]
3. **Neither** — ask the user to authenticate, then stop

# Semantic Layer (REQUIRED first step)

The governed semantic layer is the **mandatory default path** for every data question — same numbers as [the BI tool], joins/grain/filters baked in.
Raw SQL via the reference docs below is the **fallback**, used only after the semantic-layer path is shown not to cover the ask.

## Required workflow
1. **Load** — [how to load the semantic layer in each runtime, with fallbacks]
2. **Discover** — search measures/dimensions by keyword; **always check segments** (the named canonical population filters — hand-rolled WHERE clauses for these are the dominant wrong-answer mode)
3. **Compile + run** — build the spec → compile to SQL → execute
4. **Fallback** — only if discovery finds no relevant metric or compile fails → raw SQL via `references/*.md` (PART 3 below)

> **Don't bail early.** Do NOT fall back to raw SQL on these grounds:
> - "[custom date filtering / cohorts]" → [covered by time-dimension specs]
> - "[needs a join]" → [the metric layer already encapsulates its joins]
> - [3–4 more pre-rebutted excuses agents use to skip the semantic layer]

### Date windows & timezone — decide before you query
- **As-of date vs trailing-N days**: [convention for each]
- **"Last week/month"** → the last *complete* calendar week/month, not trailing-7/30
- **Timezone default**: [TZ]; [exception for certain reporting rollups]
- **Freshness lag**: [some] tables settle late — anchor on MAX(date), not "yesterday"

# PART 1: MUST KNOW (Read First for Every Request)

## Quick Start Workflow
1. **Check for red flags first**: [restricted/PII requests, gated domains, high-stakes asks that need extra validation]
2. **Out of scope — escalate, don't guess**: [access requests, pipeline troubleshooting, stale dashboards, root-cause assertions, product/pricing recommendations] → redirect to [the owning team], don't answer
3. **Clarify the request**: time period, segment, the business decision it informs
4. **Check for existing dashboards**: [per-domain dashboard catalogs]
5. **Identify the data source**: [navigation map below; prefer governed/aggregated tables]
6. **Execute the analysis**: [required filters + adversarial review]
7. **Deliver insights**: show methodology, differentiate observations from interpretations

## Business Context

### Entity Disambiguation (MUST CLARIFY)
- **"[Term A]" can mean**: [entity 1] or [entity 2] — always clarify which
- **"[Term B]" can mean**: [entity 1] → [entity 2] → [entity 3] (one-to-many chain)
- **"Users"**: [which identifier gives accurate counts, and which ones inflate them]

### Business Terminology
- [Current product names vs deprecated aliases that still appear as frozen values in the data layer — write with the new names, filter with the old]
- [Key internal acronyms]
- **[Headline metric] calculations**: [monthly / default window / leading indicator]
- **Unfamiliar terms — search [internal docs], don't guess**

### Data Integrity Requirements
- **NEVER**: make up data/columns; make speculative assertions beyond what data shows
- **ALWAYS**: use safe division; differentiate observations ("data shows X") from interpretations ("this suggests Y"); flag limitations

# PART 2: HOW TO DO (Follow During Execution)

## Technical Execution Guide
- [Managed-connection tools and CLI invocation details]
- **PII protection**: for restricted data, return the SQL for the user to run themselves — do not return results

## Analysis Best Practices Guide
1. Clarify the ask before querying
2. Show your work (filters, inclusions/exclusions, freshness)
3. Clarify denominators
4. Consider sample bias
5. Connect to business impact
6. **Adversarial SQL review (MANDATORY)** — spawn the [sql-reviewer] sub-agent for every query before the final answer; blocking findings must be fixed and re-reviewed; do not self-certify
7. **Report with provenance** — every answer ends with a footer:

> **Source:** [semantic layer | governed table | raw exploration] · **Confidence:** [tier] · **Reviewed:** [reviewer ✓, round N] · **Freshness:** [max date in the data] · **Owner:** [owning team]

# PART 3: DATA REFERENCES & RESOURCES

## Knowledge Base Navigation

### [Domain A] → `references/[domain_a].md`
- **Use for**: [kinds of questions]
- **Key tables**: [...]
- **Dashboards**: `references/[domain_a]_dashboards.json`

### [Domain B] → `references/[domain_b].md`
- **Use for**: [...]

[... one entry per business domain — a few dozen in total ...]

## Troubleshooting Guide

### When Information Is Missing
- [missing tables / access denied / outdated docs / unknown enum values → what to do]

### Field Naming Gotchas
- Use `[field_x_v2]` NOT `[field_x]`
- [Two similarly-named tables report the same metric at different grains — which to use]
- [Which of two plausible sources is canonical for the headline metric]
- [...]
