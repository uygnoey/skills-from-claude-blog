# skills-from-claude-blog

> [claude.com/blog](https://www.claude.com/blog)의 글을 Claude Code 공식 확장 규격에 맞춰 정리한 저장소.
> Anthropic과 무관한 제3자 요약 프로젝트입니다.

Claude 공식 블로그 글을 **글의 성격에 맞는 Claude Code 공식 규격**으로 변환해 모은 저장소입니다. 4시간마다 배치가 돌며 신규 글과 미처리 글을 반영합니다.

## 폴더 구조 (블로그 글 하나당)

블로그 글 하나 = 리포지토리 루트 아래 `<YYYY.MM.DD>_<blog-slug>/` 폴더 하나. 앞 날짜 접두어는 글의 `published_date`를 `YYYY.MM.DD`로 변환한 값, `<blog-slug>`는 URL 마지막 세그먼트입니다. GitHub에서 최신글부터 자연스럽게 정렬됩니다. 글의 성격에 따라 아래 폴더들이 선택적으로 들어갑니다.

```
<YYYY.MM.DD>_<blog-slug>/
├── description.en.md               # 영어 해설 (항상)
├── description.ko.md               # 한국어 해설 (항상)

├── description.ja.md               # 일본어 해설 (항상)

### 공식 규격 문서
- [Agent Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) — `SKILL.md`
- [Claude Code Subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) — `agents/<name>.md`
- [Claude Code Hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) — `hooks/<name>.json`
- [Output Styles](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles) — `output-styles/<name>.md`
- [Plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) — `plugin/` 전체 번들

### 규격 선택 매트릭스

| 판정 | 트리거 질문 | 결과물 |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Skill** | 독자가 재사용할 수 있는 **패턴·원칙·프레임워크·how-to**가 있는가? | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| **B. Subagent** | 글에 **named agent 역할**이 2개 이상 명시되어 있는가? | `agents/<name>.md` 각각 |
| **C. Guide** | 글이 **배포·아키텍처·방법론·서베이** 성격인가? | `guides/<name>.{en,ko,es,ja}.md` |
| **D. Hook** | 글이 **PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop/SessionStart 등 lifecycle event**에서의 자동화를 설명하는가? | `hooks/<name>.json` + `hooks/<name>.md` 설명 |
| **E. Output Style** | 글이 **시스템 프롬프트 톤/역할/포맷 전체 변경**을 설명하는가? (한두 문장 팁이 아닌 전체 스타일 정의) | `output-styles/<name>.md` |
| **G. Plugin** | 글이 **여러 artifact를 하나의 번들로 배포**하는 방법을 중심으로 다루는가? | `plugin/` 번들 전체 |

- **F. Slash Command은 만들지 않음.** 공식 문서가 `.claude/commands/`를 legacy로 표기하고 `.claude/skills/`를 권장 중이라, 글이 slash command를 다루면 **Skill로 변환**합니다.
- 여러 판정이 동시에 해당되는 게 정상. 전부 생성.
- 판정 불확실 시 기본값은 **A 포함**. 독자 관점에서 Skill이 가장 실용적이기 때문.
- **원문에 없는 역할·패턴·스크립트를 지어내지 않습니다.** 불확실하면 원문 인용으로 대체.

## 바로 쓰는 법

각 artifact는 그대로 해당 위치에 복사해 쓸 수 있습니다.

| Artifact | 목적지 |
|---|---|
| `skills/<name>/` | `.claude/skills/<name>/` 또는 `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` |
| `agents/<name>.md` | `.claude/agents/<name>.md` 또는 `~/.claude/agents/<name>.md` |
| `hooks/<name>.json` 내용 | `.claude/settings.json`의 `hooks` 필드에 병합 |
| `output-styles/<name>.md` | `.claude/output-styles/<name>.md` |
| `plugin/` | `--plugin-dir ./plugin` 로 로드 |

모든 가이드와 해설은 영어·한국어·스페인어·일본어로 제공되며, 각 파일 상단의 언어 선택 링크로 전환할 수 있습니다.

## 배치 운영

- Perplexity Computer 크론이 4시간마다 실행
- `https://www.claude.com/sitemap.xml`과 `/blog` 인덱스에서 글 목록 수집
- 우선순위: 마지막 배치 이후 신규 글 (최신→과거) → 미처리 기존 글 (오래된→최신) → 게시일 미상
- 한 번에 최대 2개 글 처리

## 작성 지침

1. `SKILL.md`와 `agents/*.md`는 공식 규격이 영문 기반이므로 **영문**으로 작성.
2. Hook JSON은 원문의 동작을 정확히 반영. 셸 명령은 주석으로 출처 명시.
3. Output Style은 글에 명시된 톤·역할·포맷을 그대로 옮김. 확신 없으면 guide로 돌림.
4. `name` 필드(Skill, Subagent, Output Style, Plugin)는 `^[a-z0-9-]+$`, 64자 이하, `claude`·`anthropic` 예약어 금지.
5. `description`은 3인칭, 1024자 이하 (Skill·Subagent).
6. `guides/`는 `.en.md` · `.ko.md` · `.es.md` · `.ja.md` 네 개 언어로 작성, 상단에 언어 선택 링크.
7. 사람용 해설(`description.*.md`)도 네 개 언어로 작성, 상단에 언어 선택 링크.
8. **원문에 없는 내용 창작 금지.** 불확실하면 "원문 참고"로 처리.
9. **artifact는 self-contained.** `SKILL.md`, `agents/*.md`, `hooks/*.md`, `output-styles/*.md`는 자기 폴더 밖을 참조하지 않습니다. `../` 경로, 다른 artifact 간 링크, `description.*.md`나 `guides/`로 돌아가는 링크 모두 금지. 외부 자료가 필요하면 로컬 컴패니언 파일(`references/`, `examples/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, `prompts/`, `assets/` 또는 형제 `.md`)로 복사해서 쓰세요.
